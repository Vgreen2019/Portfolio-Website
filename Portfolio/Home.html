                        I love being able to express my creativity with things. One opportunity for this is with
                        cooking.
                        From a young age I have always loved cooking things and that stayed with me into adulthood.
                        I love the idea of people coming together to share a delicious meal. My favorite part about
                        cooking is the combination of all the different spices and different flavors that can be added
                        to create the best flavor profiles.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion a good cook can take any boring meal, big or small, dress it up and make it
                        deliciousSometimes I like to try foods and figure what all was added to
                        it by just tasting it. I also love to challenge myself by picking onr or two ingredients and
                        designing a whole meal around it. Sometimes I surpirse myself with how good things turn out!

                        <p>
                            With most of my extended family being located in the south, I was introduced to traveling at
                            an early age. When I left for college, I even made it my annual ritual to visit atleast one
                            new
                            place each year. After graduation, there really was nothing holding me back. I traveled out
                            of the
                            country to Madrid, Lisbon, Porto in Portugal and Spain and it was such an amazing
                            experience. Being able to
                            immerse yourself into a culture and meet others from different backgrounds was the
                            highlight of my experience.

                <h1>Hometown...</h1>
                <p>
                    I often refer to Detroit, MI as my hometown but I actually am from a smaller city located
                    inside of Detroit called Highland Park. Detroit and Highland Park started off as two separate cities
                    but Detroit continued
                    to grow until it surrounded Highland Park. Highland Park began as a small farming community back in
                    1818. In 1907,
                    Henry Ford bought 160 acres and completed construction of the first automobile plant in that area.
                    It was the
                    second American production facility for the Model T automobile and the first factory in history to
                    assemble cars on a moving assembly line. Although, Highland Park has become alot less know over the
                    years
                    the city still has a sense of community.
