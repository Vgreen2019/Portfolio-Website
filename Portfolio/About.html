                My name is Victoria Green and I currently I work for Quicken Loans as a PC Vendor Resolution Analyst.
                On a daily basis, my job requires me jump into any escalated or problem loans and attempt to solve any
                problems dealing with other third-party companies. These problems can include lack of communication,
                missing vital information from the client, or special processing of documents. Although we are taught
                just about all of the vendor processes needed to move forward in a loan we mainly work with things like
                HOI (homeowners insurance), VOE (verification of employment), and Payoff Statements. My position can be
                demanding but its worth it to see each satisfied
                client move on to closing on time without any errors.
            </p>

                Outside of work I like to live a full and active lifestyle. I’m always trying new things and going to
                new places. The last place I visited was Houston, TX with some friends. I truly had a ball! The heat
                was perfect in comparison to our usual Midwest temperatures. We stayed in a beach house off the water
                and it was beautiful. The next place I plan on visiting before the new year will be Thailand and some
                surrounding countries. I can’t wait to taste some signature dishes and experience the historic
                landmarks.
            </p>

                I definitely can say I dance outside of my comfort zone often. Carrying this idea with me through life
                has definitely put me in the right position to always challenge myself. It’s not always easy but the
                benefits far outweigh the cons. It’s one of the main things that inspired me to learn coding. There’s
                nothing more exciting and challenging than a career based in coding and technology where everything is
                constantly changing & improving. I’m very excited to see where my new endeavors take me.
